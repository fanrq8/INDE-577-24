# INDE 577 - Data Science and Machine Learning Final Project - Supervised Learning 

## Overview
This folder contains all supervised learning projects undertaken. Prinicipal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied in Project 4.These projects leverage labeled datasets to train models that can make predictions or classify data accurately.

## Projects List
- **Project 1:** Single Neuron Model on Classification of Gender by Voice of healthy individuals 
- **Project 2:** Predicting Voice Disorder Severity using CAPE-V Parameters with Linear Regression
- **Project 3:** Logistic Regression  Model on Classification of Gender by Voice of healthy individuals 
- **Project 4:** KNN for Parkinsonâ€™s and REM Sleep Behavior Disease Detection
