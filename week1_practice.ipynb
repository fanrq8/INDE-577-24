    "**Strings** are written in '' or \"\". Stay consistent of whicheverone you used. Examples where strings in used include writing *doc strings*, printing descriptive output, and when naming the columns of tabular data (*DataFrames*).\n",
    "\n",
    "**String contentation** uses the + to connect 2 or more strings together. You can connect the first and last name in the example with this method, add blank spaces in middle. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Object-Oriented Programming** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm or style that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. \n",
    "An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior. The OOP model allows you to structure your software in a way that can be both flexible and reusable. Supports the OOP paradium and allows us to define classes, create object from those classes. Objects have methose and attributes associated to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**f string** allows us to place the value of a variable into a string with {}. *See age example below \n",

    "*Python has a set of built-in method to use on strings*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ```capitalize()```:  Converts the first character to upper case\n",
    "2. ```title()```:  Capitalizes the first letter of each word\n",
    "3. ```count()```:  Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a string *e.g. need a least a letter*\n",
    "4. ```find()```:  Searches the string for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found\n",
